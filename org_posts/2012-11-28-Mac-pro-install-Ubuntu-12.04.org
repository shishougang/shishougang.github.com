* Install rEFIt and Partition Your Mac's Hard Drive(Dual-Boot: Mac OSX and Ubuntu)
** First, install the rEFIt boot manager
http://refit.sourceforge.net/doc/c1s1_install.html
To confirm that the app is working, reboot your system: if you see a
startup menu like the one below, you're good. It may take a couple of
reboots to appear, but it worked on the first try for me.

#+begin_html

#+end_html

** Partition Your Mac's Hard Drive
*** Open Disk Utility (Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility.)
*** Select your hard drive from the list on the left, and click the Partition tab on the right.
*** You'll see the current partition layout. Click the right corner of the current partition and shrink it to the size you want. The display will show you the minimum size, so don't worry about going too far. Alternatively, just select the current partition and type in the final size 
*** Click apply. Disk Utility will shrink the current partition for you and free up space for your Ubuntu install.

* Install Ubuntu
Now that your Mac's hard drive has room for Ubuntu, pop in your
freshly burned Ubuntu CD and reboot. rEFIt will appear and ask you if
you'd like to boot to the CD. Select the CD and let Ubuntu start up.
It may take a while, but be patient. Once it's up and running, it'll
ask you if you want to try Ubuntu (as a Live CD) or install it.

start the Ubuntu Installer from the desktop icon. When prompted,
choose to manually partition. Select the EXT4 partition and click
change. Select to use the space as the EXT4 filesystem and root (/) as
the mount point. You will also want to check the box to format the
partition.

Note: if there is a warning for booting, I just ignore it and it
has no problem.

* Let rEFIt Fix Your Partition Tables
According to [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation][Ubuntu's Mactel]] installation guide, there's a bug in the
Ubuntu installer that can cause boot problems after installing and
cause problems booting into OS X or Ubuntu. Thankfully, it's an easy
fix for rEFIt, you just have to boot into rEFIt's partition tool and
check. Here's how:

+ Reboot your Mac. When rEFIt appears, select the "Partition Tool" from the startup menu.
+ The tool will load automatically. In most cases, rEFIt will notice
  the problem, and ask you for permission to sync your partition
  tables. Type "Y."

+ The process takes a couple of seconds, but when it's finished, shut
  down your Mac. rEFIt hasn't read the new partition tables yet, so if
  you try to boot into anything at this stage, your Mac will hang.

+ Start your Mac again, and pick your preferred OS. If you enter the
  Partition Tool again, you'll see a notification that your partition
  tables are in sync.

Now here's the catch: If the rEFIt partition tool tells you that the
tables are out of sync but doesn't offer to fix them, or if you see
another strange error message, head over to [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation#Detailed_How-To][this section of the Ubuntu
install guide]] and scroll down to "Fix Your Partition Tables" for a
breakdown of what you should do for each type of error.

* configuration
** Screen(Not) 
The resolution is right recognised, the LED-backlit works properly.

NOTE: In order to be able to adjust the brightness you will have to
install the apple-gmux package and boot with acpi_backlight=vendor
kernel parameter which you can set e.g. in the /etc/default/grub file
in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX line. Details:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/AppleGmuxBacklight

** Colors
import these profiles as .icc files in System Settings - Color by
 selecting the appropriate screen icon, clicking "add profile" and
 navigating to the .icc files (located in OS X under
 =/Users/username/Library/ColorSync/Profiles= or
 =/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/Displays=
 if the settings were saved for all users). After this, 
choosing the radio button under the new OS X profile should
 yield a nice color profile. 
** HFS+
HFS is mounted as Read-Only. By turning [[http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2355][journaling]] off in OS X, the
HFS+ file system will be read/write under Linux. 

This is the recommended solution if you need read/write access to your OS X partition.

It's also possible to mount HFS+ journaling-enabled volumes using the
"-o force,rw" option though this is extremely risky.

Leaving the HFS's journaling turned on you're able to access it as root. 
** Touchpad
Works fine out-of-the-box. You can disable the mouse-click with the
trackpad tap and the horizontal scrolling in Preferences.

Unity supports multitouch with this funcs:
#+begin_src sh
    1 finger
        move = move the cursor;
        click = "your-favourite-hand"-click; 
    2 fingers
        move = vertical/horizontal scrolling;
        click = "2nd-button"-click; 
    3 fingers
        move = move the window and shows resizing options; 
    4 fingers
        move = show/hide the launcher (horizontal-scroll, enable auto-hide the launcher first);
        single-tap = show the dash. 
#+end_src
To get multitouch with just two finger scrolling and drag-and-drop
follow these instructions:

#+begin_src sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mactel-support && sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics
#+end_src

*** Palm Recognition

By default palm recognition is not turned off, so you might have trouble moving the cursor or clicking something by brushing the trackpad with your palm while typing. To turn palm recognition on, open up a terminal and copy your default conf file:
#+begin_src sh
sudo cp /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/my-synaptics.conf
#+end_src
Now edit the new conf file:
#+begin_src sh
gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/my-synaptics.conf
#+end_src
and add the following line just before the EndSection marker of your input class:
#+begin_src sh
Option "PalmDetect" "on"
#+end_src
*** Fine-tuning the touchpad
You can play with other options offered by Synaptic 
input drivers that are explained [[http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/karmic/man4/synaptics.4.html][here]] and in this [[http://uselessuseofcat.com/?p=74][blog post]]. 

** TODO External Monitor
External monitors connected via HDMI work out of the box.

If your external display's native resolution is not recognised when
 connected via a VGA port (only a lower resolution, such as 800x600 is 
offered, for example), then you need to issue a couple of xrandr 
commands in a terminal to force add the desired resolution. 
The source of information for this fix comes from [[http://mac.linux.be/content/setting-xorgconf-manually-xrandr][here]].

To check that xrandr is installed issue:
#+begin_src sh
$ sudo apt-get install xrandr
#+end_src
You have to create a modeline using the gtf or cvt utility. For
example, if you want to add a mode with resolution 1920x1080, you can
enter the following command (The output is shown following):

#+begin_src sh
$ cvt 1920 1080
# 1920x1080 59.96 Hz (CVT 2.07M9) hsync: 67.16 kHz; pclk: 173.00 MHz
Modeline "1920x1080_60.00"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
#+end_src
Then copy the information after the word "Modeline" into the xrandr command (which would in my example state):
#+begin_src sh
xrandr --newmode "1920x1080_60.00"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
#+end_src
Now get the code of your external monitor by issuing xrandr. For me the external screen is branded DP1.

Now add this mode to the available ones for your external screen:
#+begin_src sh
xrandr --addmode DP1 1920x1080_60.00
#+end_src
And select it:
#+begin_src sh
xrandr --output DP1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00
#+end_src
If everything goes well, the resolution should be ok now and you'll have the desired option in the normal display preferences. This will have to be repeated every time. The easiest way to automate the task, add the 3 xrandr commands to the ~/.xprofile file.
#+begin_src sh
$ gedit ~/.xprofile
#+end_src
The file should look something like:
#+begin_src sh
xrandr --newmode "1920x1080_60.00"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
xrandr --addmode DP1 1920x1080_60.00
xrandr --output DP1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00
#+end_src
Afterwards, you have to add executable access to the file:
#+begin_src sh
$ chmod +x ~/.xprofile
#+end_src
Note: if you make a mistake in the .xprofile file, you might have trouble reverting back to normal settings - in this case you can always use ctrl+alt+F1 to open the shell interface and issue mv ~/.xprofile ~/.xprofile-old; sudo reboot to get the previous settings back. 

** Sound
Works out-of the box, but some volume corrections are necessary.

You can install gnome-alsamixer for a nice GUI to set up your sound:
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer
#+end_src
** Wireless(more [fn:2])
   There is no official support yet in Ubuntu 11.10, but you can get
   it working with the following repository:

#+begin_src sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mpodroid/mactel
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer
#+end_src
Then install the =linux-backports-modules-cw-3.2-oneiric-generic= or, if
you have the pae kernel installed, the
=linux-backports-modules-cw-3.2-oneiric-generic-pae= package. While this
tutorial deals with Oneiric, the same instructions for the wireless
work for Precise, with the above installation of
"=linux-backports-modules-cw-3.2-oneiric-generic=" replaced with
"=linux-backports-modules-cw-3.3-precise-generic=" .


Edit the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and add the line:
#+begin_src sh
blacklist ndiswrapper
#+end_src
Create or edit the file =/etc/pm/config.d/modules= and make sure the
wireless modules (b43 and bcma) are blacklisted:

#+begin_src sh
SUSPEND_MODULES="b43 bcma"
#+end_src
Reboot and the wireless should work. 

** Graphics
System info says
#+begin_src sh
Graphics: unknown.  
Driver: unknown,  
Experience: Standard.
#+end_src
it means that it cannot acquire the information because glxinfo is not installed on the system.

Install it by clicking here:
https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/mesa-utils/
Install via the software center

Or by typing:
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
#+end_src

* Install Software
** lightum[fn:3]
Lightum is a daemon to control the keyboard brightness and screen backlight on MacBook based laptops.

If you are running Ubuntu, you can install it by adding lightum-mba ppa to your system:
#+begin_src sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:poliva/lightum-mba
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lightum
#+end_src
Otherwise, you can build it from [[https://github.com/poliva/lightum][source]]. 
** lightum-indicator[fn:4]
#+begin_src sh
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:poliva/lightum-mba
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install lightum-indicator
#+end_src
** ubuntu-tweak
#+begin_src sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak
#+end_src
** gnome
ubuntu 12.04 中安装gnome桌面的命令为：
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback
也可以用：
sudo apt-get install gnome-panel
#+end_src

安装好gnome桌面后注销重新登录，在用户名右边有一个图标，可以选择使用进入的桌面，我选择了gnome classic，然后就可以重返经典的gnome桌面了。
在删除unity桌面之前，要把ubuntu默认的登录界面也改为gnome，命令如下：
#+begin_src sh
sudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults -s gnome-classic
#+end_src
这是设置登录界面为 gnome classic的，如果你喜欢gnome3，则用：
#+begin_src sh
sudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults -s gnome-shell
#+end_src
接下来就可以卸载unity了。
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get -y -–auto-remove purge unity
sudo apt-get -y -–auto-remove purge unity-commonp
sudo apt-get -y -–auto-remove purge unity-lens*
sudo apt-get -y -–auto-remove purge unity-services
sudo apt-get -y –-auto-remove purge unity-asset-pool
#+end_src
