** 4.3 Heapsort: Fast Sorting via Data Structures
*** Where in the Heap?
Problem: Given an array-based heap on n elements and a real number x,
efficiently determine whether the kth smallest element in the heap is
greater than or equal to x. Your algorithm should be O(k) in the
worst-case, independent of the size of the heap. Hint: you do not have
to find the kth smallest element; you need only determine its
relationship to x.

Solution: There are at least two different ideas that lead to correct
but inefficient algorithms for this problem:

1. Call extract-minktimes, and test whether all of these are less
   thanx. This explicitly sorts the firstkelements and so gives us
   more information than the desired answer, but it takes O(klogn) time
   to do so.
2. The kth smallest element cannot be deeper than the kth level of the
   heap, since the path from it to the root must go through elements
   of decreasing value. Thus we can look at all the elements on the
   first k levels of the heap, and count how many of them are less
   thanx, stopping when we either find k of them or run out of
   elements. This is correct, but takes O(min(n,2^k-1)) time, since
   the top k elements have 2^k-1 elements.

An O(k) solution can look at only k elements smaller than x, plus at
most O(k) elements greater than x. Consider the following recursive
procedure, called at the root with i= 1 with count=k:

#+begin_html
<!-- more -->
#+end_html


#+begin_src c++
  int heap_compare(priority_queue *q, int i, int count, int x)
  {
    if ((count <= 0) || (i > q->n)) return(count);
    if (q->q[i] < x) {
      count = heap_compare(q, pq_young_child(i), count-1, x);
      count = heap_compare(q, pq_young_child(i)+1, count, x);
    }
    return(count);
  }
#+end_src

If the root of the min-heap is ≥ x, then no elements in the heap can
be less than x, as by definition the root must be the smallest
element. This procedure searches the children of all nodes of weight
smaller than x until either (a) we have found k of them, when it returns
0, or (b) they are exhausted, when it returns a value greater than
zero. Thus it will find enough small elements if they exist.

But how long does it take? The only nodes whose children we look at
are those < x, and at most k of these in total. Each have at most
visited two children, so we visit at most 3k nodes, for a total time
of O(k).
** 4.5 Mergesort: Sorting by Divide-and-Conquer
Mergesort is a great algorithm for sorting linked lists, because it
does not rely on random access to elements as does heapsort or
quicksort. Its primary disadvantage is the need for an auxilliary
buffer when sorting arrays. It is easy to merge two sorted linked
lists without using any extra space, by just rearranging the pointers.
However, to merge two sorted arrays (or portions of an array), we need
use a third array to store the result of the merge to avoid stepping
on the component arrays

** 4.9 Binary Search and Related Algorithms
#+begin_src c++
  int binary_search(item_type s[], item_type key, int low, int high)
  {
    int middle; /* index of middle element */
    if (low > high) return (-1); /* key not found */
    middle = (low+high)/2;
    if (s[middle] == key) return(middle);
    if (s[middle] > key)
      return (binary_search(s,key,low,middle-1));
    else
      return (binary_search(s,key,middle+1,high));
  }
#+end_src

*** Counting Occurrences
This algorithm runs inO(lgn+s), wheresis the number of occurrences of
the key. This can be as bad as linear if the entire array consists of
identical keys. A faster algorithm results by modifying binary search
to search for the boundary of the block containing k, instead of
kitself. Suppose we delete the equality test

~if (s[middle] == key) return(middle);~

from the implementation above and return the index =low= instead of
=−1= on each unsuccessful search. All searches will now be
unsuccessful, since there is no equality test. The search will proceed
to the right half whenever the key is compared to an identical array
element, eventually terminating at the *right boundary*. Repeating the
search after reversing the direction of the binary comparison will
lead us to the *left boundary*. Each search takes O(lgn) time, so we can
count the occurrences in logarithmic time regardless of the size of
the block.

*** One-Sided Binary Search
Now suppose we have an array A consisting of a run of 0’s, followed
by an unbounded run of 1’s, and would like to identify the exact
point of transition between them. Binary search on the array would
provide the transition point in lgn tests, if we had a bound non the
number of elements in the array. In the absence of such
a bound, we can test repeatedly at larger intervals (~A[1], A[2],
A[4], A[8], A[16],...~) until we find a first nonzero value. Now we
have a window containing the target and can proceed with binary
search. This /one-sided binary search/ finds the transition pointpusing at
most 2lgp comparisons, regardless of how large the array actually is.

*** Square and Other Roots
First, observe that the square root ofn≥1 must be at least 1 and at
most n. Let ~l = 1~ and ~r = n~. Consider the midpoint of this
interval, ~m=(l+r)/2~. How does m^2 compare to n? If n≥m^2 , then the
square root must be greater than m, so the algorithm repeats with
~l=m~. If n<m^2 , then the square root must be less than m, so the
algorithm repeats with ~r=m~. 

Suppose that we start with values l and r such that f(l)>0 and f(r)<0.
If f is a continuous function, there must exist a root between l and
r. Depending upon the sign of f(m), where ~m=(l+r)/2~, we can cut this
window containing the root in half with each test and stop soon as our
estimate becomes sufficiently accurate.
** 4.10 Divide-and-Conquer
divide-and-conquer recurrences of the form T(n)=aT(n/b)+f(n)

1. If $f(n) = O(n^{log_{b}^{a-\epsilon}})$ for some constant $\epsilon
   > 0$, then $T(n) = \Theta(n^{log_{b}^a})$.
2. If $f(n) = O(n^{log_{b}^{a}})$, then $T(n) =
   \Theta(n^{log_{b}^a}lgn)$.
3. If $f(n) = O(n^{log_{b}^{a+\epsilon}})$ for some constant $\epsilon
   > 0$ and if $af(n/b) \leq cf(n)$ for some $c<1$, then $T(n) =
   \Theta(f(n))$.

of n players each. Each player has a numerical rating that measures
how good he/she is at the game. He seeks to divide the players as

Take a sequence of 2n real numbers as input. Design an O(nlogn)
algorithm that partitions the numbers intonpairs, with the property
that the partition minimizes the maximum sum of a pair. For example,
say we are given the numbers (1,3,5,9). The possible partitions are
((1,3),(5,9)), ((1,5),(3,9)), and ((1,9),(3,5)). The pair sums for
these partitions are (4,14), (6,12), and (10,8). Thus the third
partition has 10 as its maximum sum, which is the minimum over the
three partitions.

A company database consists of 10,000 sorted names, 40% of whom are known as good customers and who together account for 60% of the accesses to the database. There are two data structure options to consider for representing the database:
1. Put all the names in a single array and use binary search.
2. Put the good customers in one array and the rest of them in a
   second array.

Only if we do not find the query name on a binary search of the first
array do we do a binary search of the second array. Demonstrate which
option gives better expected performance. Does this change if linear
search on an unsorted array is used instead of binary search for both
options?

+ single array: log10000=4
+ two array: 0.6*log4000+0.4*(log4000+log6000) = 5.11
single array is better.

+ single array: 10000
+ two array: 0.6*4000+0.4*6000 = 6400
two array is better.

 Suppose you are given an array A of n sorted numbers that has been
 circularly shifted k positions to the right. For example,
 {35,42,5,15,27,29} is a sorted array that has been circularly shifted
 k = 2 positions, while {27,29,35,42,5,15} has been shifted k = 4
 positions.

1. Suppose you know what k is. Give an O(1) algorithm to find the
   largest number in A.

2. Suppose you do not know what k is. Give an O(lgn) algorithm to find
   the largest number in A. For partial credit, you may give an O(n)
   algorithm.

    if (k == 0) {
      return A[n-1];
    } else {

Consider the numerical 20 Questions game. In this game, Player 1
thinks of a number in the range 1 to n. Player 2 has to figure out
this number by asking the fewest number of true/false questions.
Assume that nobody cheats.

1. What is an optimal strategy if n is known?
2. What is a good strategy if n is not known?


1. binary search.
2. 2^{i}随机选一个i，若数小，增加到2^{i+1},若大就二分搜索。

 Suppose that you are given a sorted sequence of distinct integers .
 Give an O(lgn) algorithm to determine whether there exists an i index
 such as ai = i. For example, in { − 10, − 3,3,5,7}, a3 = 3. In
 {2,3,4,5,6,7}, there is no such i.

 Let M be an n*m  integer matrix in which the entries of each row are
 sorted in increasing order (from left to right) and the entries in
 each column are in increasing order (from top to bottom). Give an
 efficient algorithm to find the position of an integer x in M, or to
 determine that x is not there. How many comparisons of x with matrix
 entries does your algorithm use in worst case?

Consider an n*n  array A containing integer elements (positive, negative,
and zero). Assume that the elements in each row of A are in strictly
increasing order, and the elements of each column of A are in strictly
decreasing order. (Hence there cannot be two zeroes in the same row or
the same column.) Describe an efficient algorithm that counts the
number of occurrences of the element 0 in A. Analyze its running time.

#+begin_src c++
int CountZero(int **array, int n) {
  int row = n - 1, col = n - 1;
  int count = 0;
  while (row >=0 && col >= 0) {

      count++;
      row--;

 If you are given a million integers to sort, what algorithm would you
 use to sort them? How much time and memory would that consume?

1. 一个整数４字节，10^9*4=4G,需要4G的内存，可以用快排等O(nlogn)的排序算法．
2. 用bitmap,需要10^{9}/8=128M的内存.
3. 若内存有限,就external merge sort,利用外部存储多进行几次.
